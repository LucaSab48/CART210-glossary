##Virtual Reality (VR)
Virtual Reality is a digitally created 360-degree environment that a user can engage with utilizing special equipment. The use of this technology allows users to partake in a more immersive experience as well as allowing artists to create these captivating pieces for their ideas[^toronto22virtual]. Some historians believe the birth of virtual reality was in 1780s, with the birth of Robert Barker. He created the first grand display concept, inventing the panorama[^greengard19virtual]. Regardless of the lack of technology, Barker’s goal remained the same as virtual reality: creating an immersive experience.
While the definition above explains the technological interpretation of virtual reality, there is an epistemological representation as well. Looking at the formation of the term, the word “virtual” can evoke synonyms such as “fake” or “illusionary” which implies some negative or cautionary connotations[^myeung01virtual]. The meaning of “virtual” is being in essence or effect, not fact. Essentially, virtual reality can be portrayed as non-existent world, which can blur the lines between reality and fantasy and pose philosophical dilemmas. 
In relation to New Media Theory, virtual reality can be used to create innovative and immersive experiences. It is a form of emerging technology that may affect the ways we communicate with each other in the near future. Virtual reality represents a potential for many new media theory concepts, such as hypermediacy. That is the concept of a multi-sensory environment where users can interact with it, blurring the lines between simulation and reality. There is also the idea of simulated environments that is involved when making  a VR experience.
