##Surveillance Capitalism
Surveillance capitalism is defined as an economic strategy to collect large amounts of user data and analyze it to predict the behavior of users and influence them for commercial gain. A simple example of this is targeted ads that aim to sell you items that an algorithm has determined compatible with products available for purchase[^foster19surveillance]. Essentially, companies have figured out a way to monetize user data. The way these companies extract the data from its users vary, such as: cookies from websites, social media, search engines, even the devices themselves. Unfortunately, this practice is an invasive use of technology that even effects the lives and protection of children. Kids born after the internet boom have had all their information stored through the different stages of their life[^holloway19surveillance]. From the time they were born to the day they will die; surveillance capitalism has collected data on them continuously. 
The term surveillance capitalism was coined by Shoshana Zuboff, a scholar from Harvard, in her 2014 essay entitled: ‘A Digital Declaration: Big Data as Surveillance Capitalism’. She explained that the first corporation to practice this concept was Google, who was then soon followed by Facebook[^venkatesh21capitalism]. In recent years, there has been much discussion about the misuse certain companies have over their user’s data. For example, the Cambridge Analytica scandal for facebook exposed their complete abuse of power over their users data, taking it from people who have not agreed to share any personal information to create psychological profiles and targeted political ads[^foster19surveillance]. The concept of “Big Other” was also created in reference to surveillance capitalism to describe the corporations that harvest the data to exploit its users. This is a clear reference to Orsen Well’s 1984 Big Brother concept, which has very similar themes of constant surveillance[^venkatesh21capitalism]. 
In relation to new media theory, surveillance capitalism exploits emerging technologies and communication platforms to harvest the data needed to create profiles on their users to sell to ad companies and even scammers. New media theory must incorporate regulatory practices and ehtics as it progresses to combat the “Big Other”. As technology advances, users must learn to protect their data from these companies. However, bid data will always be adapting to find new ways to exploit people and increase profit margins.
